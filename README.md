## Mock Data
The chatbot replies are powered by hardcoded mock data in `mockData.js`:

```javascript
export const mockResponses = {
  "books under $20": [
    "Atomic Habits",
    "The Alchemist",
    "Harry Potter 1"
  ],
  "electronics": [
    "Wireless Mouse",
    "Mechanical Keyboard",
    "Bluetooth Headphones"
  ],
  "textiles": [
    "Cotton T-shirt",
    "Silk Scarf",
    "Denim Jacket"
  ]
};
```

## Future Improvements
- Connect to a real backend API for dynamic product responses.
- Add user authentication for personalized recommendations.
- Implement advanced message features like filters and pagination.
